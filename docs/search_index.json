"],["introduction-to-rstudio.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction to RStudio 2.1 What is R 2.2 What is RStudio 2.3 Install R + RStudio 2.4 Familiar with the user interface of RStudio 2.5 Create and save R file 2.6 Print Hello, world 2.7 Install and use R Packages 2.8 Make notes 2.9 Tips", " Chapter 2 Introduction to RStudio In this chapter, we will cover some basic operations in RStudio. 2.1 What is R R is a type of programming language and supports many tasks including statistical computation (data cleaning, data management, statistics, machine learning) and graphics (static plots and interactive plots). You can also use it to create website (like this course website), write papers, analyze texts, etc. The most important thing is that R is free and easy to use, thats why it has been applied in many fields. 2.2 What is RStudio RStudio is a programming software for editing and running R code. It has many great features to make R programming easier! 2.3 Install R + RStudio For better coding and running R, you should install both R and RStudio. You could code R with the installation of R only, however, RStudio provides you with more convenience in coding. In this course, we will use RStudio to do all the course lectures and exercises. Please make sure you install both of them! R could be downloaded here and RStudio could be downloaded here (choose the free version). Both Windows OS (Operating System) and Mac OS are supported. You should choose the right one you need for your own system. (If you have any questions about the installation of R or RStudio, please come during the office hours or ask IT for help). 2.4 Familiar with the user interface of RStudio Below is a screenshot of the user interface of RStudio. You will find couple of panes/windows with different usages.(Selvam 2019) Menu/Tool Bar Source The pane where you write and edit your codes. Environment/History Environment lists all the variables that you are currently using. History presents the codes you have run before. Console Console is the original R interactive window. You could run codes and see the results here. Plot/Help Plot window shows the output figures. Help window presents the information of the function or package you are checking. 2.5 Create and save R file Three ways to create an R file in the RStudio: 1. Menu -&gt; File -&gt; New File -&gt; R Script 2. Shortcut: Ctrl + Shift + N 3. Tool Bar -&gt; New file button Also three ways to save R file 1. Menu -&gt; File -&gt; Save 2. Shortcut: Ctrl + S 3. Tool Bar -&gt; Save file button 2.6 Print Hello, world Its time to code something and output the results! Lets print the very classic Hello, world! with print() function. After coding, we could run our codes in several ways: Select the codes or put the cursor in the line of your code, and click the Run button located in the right-top position of the source pane. Select the codes or put the cursor in the line of your code, and use shortcut: Ctrl + Enter You could also click the Re-run button near the Run button to re-run the codes you ran last time. print(&#39;Hello, world!&#39;) ## [1] &quot;Hello, world!&quot; Because what we need to output here is a string variable, we have to put them in the quotation mark. Either single quotation or double quotation mark works well. Lets see another example. print(5928) ## [1] 5928 Here, 5928 is an integer and we do not need to put them in the quotation marks. 2.7 Install and use R Packages R is easy to use because it has tons of packages with different usages. These packages could help you accomplish some complex tasks with just several lines of codes (another reason we like to use R). Some packages have already been installed and you could use them directly, which are base packages. However, most of the packages have to be installed before being called in the codes. There are couple of ways you could install a package. Lets take the tidyverse package for example. 1. Manu -&gt; Tools -&gt; Install Packages... -&gt; Input the package name -&gt; Click Install button 2. Use the code below: install.packages(&quot;gbm&quot;) After the installation of the package, you have import it with library() function before you use the functions in the package. library(gbm) ## Loaded gbm 2.1.8 We will spend more time in future classes to explore the various R packages and their usages. 2.8 Make notes It is important to write notes for your codes. It could help others or even yourself understand your codes easily. Use hash tag to indicate the notes. For example, gbm1 &lt;- gbm(AvgMet~PkAreaH+StpNumH+DisToMin, # formula data=MetM, # dataset var.monotone=c(+1, rep(0,10),rep(0,15)), distribution=&quot;gaussian&quot;, # see the help for other choices n.trees=5000, # number of trees shrinkage=0.001, # shrinkage or learning rate, 0.001 to 0.1 usually work interaction.depth=6, # 1: additive model, 2: two-way interactions, etc. bag.fraction = 0.5, # subsampling fraction, 0.5 is probably best n.minobsinnode = 10, # minimum total weight needed in each node cv.folds = 5) R will not run the codes after hash tags in each line. Please try to write simple but necessary notes for the codes. Keep this as a good habit and you will thank yourself in the future. 2.9 Tips You could divide your codes into sections by putting chunks before each sections with the shortcut Ctrl + Shift + R. This will help you organize your codes. You could run the codes in the chunk by the shortcut Ctrl + Alt + T. Use ? or help() function to find the related instruction or help page, for example, if you want to find the instruction of library() function, just code ?library or help(library) Both will direct you to the instruction page in the help window where you can find how to use these functions. "],["introduction-to-r.html", "Chapter 3 Introduction to R 3.1 Why R and why not R? 3.2 Variable name 3.3 Variable types 3.4 Operations 3.5 Data structures 3.6 Conditional statement (if) 3.7 Loops 3.8 Functions", " Chapter 3 Introduction to R 3.1 Why R and why not R? Before learning R, we need to know why we use R and why we do not use R. Advantages of R (More flexible but less formal) Free and Open source More advanced technique packages Deal with more than one datasets (big data) at the same time Deal with not only data analysis tasks (data visualization, text analysis, creating website, etc.) Advantages of STATA (More formal but less flexible) More algorithms, packages, and implementations of econometrics Faster It is supported by Statacorp so the result is reliable It presents results in a clear format Syntax is simple and standard for most data analysis Help document is formal Besides those advantages, they have a lot of overlaps with each other. People cannot say one is absolutely better than the other. People choose them based on their task requirements. Sometimes, people use both of them for their daily work (e.g., my laptop has both R and STATA). 3.2 Variable name A variable is used to store data including value, vector, data frame, etc., which R could use to manipulate (tutorialspoint 2019b). This chapter introduces variable types, operations between variables, data structures, conditional statements, loops, and functions. Before we start, lets first see how to name a variable. The valid variable name could be constructed with letters, numbers, the dot character (.), and underline character (_). Besides that, a valid variable name should start with a letter or the dot character not followed by a number. Below are some examples of variable names (either good or not good). Examples Validity Discussion var.name  var_name  _var_name  Cannot start with the underline .var_name  var%name  Cannot contain % .2var_name  Cannot use the dot followed by a number to start a variable name 2var_name  Cannot start with a number 3.3 Variable types There are several types of variables which R could recognize, including character, numeric, integer, logical, and complex (Blischak et al. 2019). The type of one variable is decided by the type of value it stores. We can use class() function to check the type of each variable. Character (also known as strings) v &lt;- &quot;Hello, world!&quot; class(v) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; Numeric (real or decimal number/integer) v &lt;- 59.28 class(v) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; Integer (L tells R that this number is an integer) v &lt;- 2L class(v) ## [1] &quot;integer&quot; v &lt;-2 class(v) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; Logical (Usually True or false) v &lt;- TRUE class(v) ## [1] &quot;logical&quot; v &lt;- FALSE class(v) ## [1] &quot;logical&quot; Complex (complex number is another type of number, different with real number) v &lt;- 1 + 4i class(v) ## [1] &quot;complex&quot; It is important to clearly know the type of the variable since different types of variables may have different functions or operations to deal with. Another caveat is that the outlook of the variable may not show its real variable type. For example, a common situation is listed below. v &lt;- &quot;59.28&quot; class(v) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; Here, the number has quotation marks outside, which means it has been transferred to type character. Therefore, please be careful about variable types! 3.4 Operations An operation tells R the mathematical or logical manipulations among variables (tutorialspoint 2019a). 3.4.1 Assignment operations Assignment operators assign values to variables. Left assignment a &lt;- 1 b &lt;&lt;- &quot;Hello, world!&quot; c = c(1, 3, 4) Right assignment 1 -&gt; a 2 -&gt;&gt; b 3.4.2 Arithmetic operations Add 1 + 1 ## [1] 2 Subtract 5 - 3 ## [1] 2 Multiple 3 * 5 ## [1] 15 Divide 5 - 3 ## [1] 2 Power 5 ^ 2 ## [1] 25 5 ** 2 # you can also do power operation like this ## [1] 25 Mode (find the remainder) 5 %% 2 ## [1] 1 3.4.3 Relational operations The relational operators compare the two elements and return a logical value (TRUE or FALSE). Larger 3 &gt; 4 ## [1] FALSE 5 &gt; 3 ## [1] TRUE Smaller 3 &lt; 5 ## [1] TRUE 4 &lt; 2 ## [1] FALSE Equal 4 == 4 ## [1] TRUE 5 == 4 ## [1] FALSE No less than (larger or equal to) 3 &gt;= 4 ## [1] FALSE 2 &gt;= 2 ## [1] TRUE No larger than (smaller or equal to) 5 &lt;= 2 ## [1] FALSE 5 &lt;= 5 ## [1] TRUE Not equal 3 != 4 ## [1] TRUE 3 != 3 ## [1] FALSE 3.4.4 Logical operations Logical operators are operations only for logical, numeric, or complex variable types. Most of the time, we apply them on logical values or variables. For numeric variables, 0 is considered FALSE and non-zero numbers are taken as TRUE (DataMentor 2019). You could use T for TRUE or F for FALSE as abbreviation. Logical And TRUE &amp; TRUE ## [1] TRUE FALSE &amp; TRUE ## [1] FALSE FALSE &amp; FALSE ## [1] FALSE Logical Or TRUE | TRUE ## [1] TRUE FALSE | TRUE ## [1] TRUE FALSE | FALSE ## [1] FALSE Logical Not ! TRUE ## [1] FALSE ! FALSE ## [1] TRUE 3.5 Data structures Variables and values could construct different data structures including vector, matrix, data frame, list, and factor (Kabacoff 2019). Vector You could create a vector with c() function. a &lt;- c(5, 9, 2, 8) # create a numeric vector a # show the value of this vector ## [1] 5 9 2 8 b &lt;- c(&#39;hello&#39;, &#39;world&#39;, &#39;!&#39;) # character vector b ## [1] &quot;hello&quot; &quot;world&quot; &quot;!&quot; c &lt;- c(5, &#39;good&#39;) # if you create a vector containing mixed variable types, such as numeric and character, R will restrict them to be the same variable type, here, character c ## [1] &quot;5&quot; &quot;good&quot; You could select elements in the vector by using var_name[#]. Please pay attention on how R indexes its elements in the data structure. a[3] # select the 3rd element ## [1] 2 b[1:3] # select from the 1st to the 3rd element ## [1] &quot;hello&quot; &quot;world&quot; &quot;!&quot; c[2] # select the 2nd element ## [1] &quot;good&quot; 1:3 means from 1 to 3, so it actually stands for three numbers here, which are 1, 2, 3. Matrix You could create a matrix using matrix() function. a &lt;- matrix(1:6, # the data to be put in the matrix, here we use numbers from 1 to 6 nrow = 2, # number of rows in the matrix ncol = 3, # number of columns in the matrix byrow = FALSE) # how to arrange the data in the matrix, FALSE means by columns, TURE means by rows. a ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 3 5 ## [2,] 2 4 6 For variable selection, the intuitive way is using coordinates. a[2,3] # select the elements in the 2nd row and 3rd column ## [1] 6 You could also select the entire row or column. a[ ,2] # the 2nd column ## [1] 3 4 a[1, ] # the 1st row ## [1] 1 3 5 Data frame Data frame is a frequently-used data type in R. It could include columns with different types of values stored in them. Lets create a data frame with mixed variables types using data.frame() function. ID &lt;- c(1:4) # create ID Name &lt;- c(&#39;A&#39;, &#39;B&#39;, &#39;C&#39;, &#39;D&#39;) # create Name Score &lt;- c(69.5, 77.5, 81.5, 90) # create Score df &lt;- data.frame(ID, Name, Score) # combine the variables into one data frame called df df ## ID Name Score ## 1 1 A 69.5 ## 2 2 B 77.5 ## 3 3 C 81.5 ## 4 4 D 90.0 We created a data frame storing the students ID, name, and their test scores. We can select elements from this data frame with couple of ways. df[2,3] # 2nd row and 3rd column ## [1] 77.5 df[&#39;ID&#39;] # column of variable ID ## ID ## 1 1 ## 2 2 ## 3 3 ## 4 4 df[c(&#39;ID&#39;, &#39;Score&#39;)] # column of ID and Score ## ID Score ## 1 1 69.5 ## 2 2 77.5 ## 3 3 81.5 ## 4 4 90.0 There is another way to select the column by its name, which is more frequently used. When you type $ after the name of the data frame, RStudio will list all the variables in that data frame. df$Name # column of variable Name ## [1] A B C D ## Levels: A B C D List A list could store mixed types of values, which is different from vector. a &lt;- list(ID = c(1, 2), Name = c(&#39;A&#39;, &#39;B&#39;), Score = c(69.5, 89)) When you want to select elements from a list, you could do it in a similar way as a vector. However, list does not define row or column, so you cannot use 2-D coordinates to select elements like a data frame. a[1] ## $ID ## [1] 1 2 a[2:3] ## $Name ## [1] &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; ## ## $Score ## [1] 69.5 89.0 Someone might be confusing since list looks similar to data frame. Here is a good discussion about it. Due to the time limitation, we will not cover this discussion in class. The main idea is that list is more flexible than data frame, while data frame has more restrictions. However, since data frame is more similar to 2-D table structure which is more frequently used in our daily work, we use data frame more than list. Factor Factor is the nominal variable in R. This type will be very useful when we want to analyze data from different groups, such as gender, school, etc. a &lt;- c(1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1) class(a) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; afactor &lt;- factor(a) class(afactor) ## [1] &quot;factor&quot; 3.6 Conditional statement (if) if (test_expression){ statement_1 } else { statement_2 } If the test_expression returns TRUE, then the codes will go to statement_1, if it returns FALSE, the codes will go to statement_2. You could also omit the else part. if (test_expression){ statement_1 } If the test_expression returns FALSE, the codes will continue to next line. x &lt;- 5 if (x &gt; 3){ print(&#39;x is larger than 3&#39;) } else { print(&#39;x is not larger than 3&#39;) } ## [1] &quot;x is larger than 3&quot; x &lt;- 1 if (x &gt; 3){ print(&#39;x is larger than 3&#39;) } Some other conditional statements include switch and which. 3.7 Loops Loops help us repeat the codes we want to run in more than one time. for loop is the intuitive and commonly-used one. for (range){ statement } range will provide the range for a variable. for (i in 1:3){ print(i) } ## [1] 1 ## [1] 2 ## [1] 3 3.8 Functions Functions are codes have been defined with specific usage. You only need to input some necessary variables and functions will do the tasks and return the result. For example, sum() function could help you add the all the numbers togethor in a vector or data frame and return the result. sum(c(1, 4, 10, 5)) ## [1] 20 Another example is mean() function, which could help you average the numbers in a vector or data frame and return the result. mean(c(1, 4, 10, 5)) ## [1] 5 It is important to use the right function to do the right task. To do this, you have to be familiar with the functions you are using. It needs more practice.
