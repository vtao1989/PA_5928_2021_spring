"],["introduction-to-rstudio.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction to RStudio 2.1 What is R 2.2 What is RStudio 2.3 Install R + RStudio 2.4 Familiar with the user interface of RStudio 2.5 Create and save R file 2.6 Print Hello, world 2.7 Install and use R Packages 2.8 Make notes 2.9 Tips", " Chapter 2 Introduction to RStudio In this chapter, we will cover some basic operations in RStudio. 2.1 What is R R is a type of programming language and supports many tasks including statistical computation (data cleaning, data management, statistics, machine learning) and graphics (static plots and interactive plots). You can also use it to create website (like this course website), write papers, analyze texts, etc. The most important thing is that R is free and easy to use, thats why it has been applied in many fields. 2.2 What is RStudio RStudio is a programming software for editing and running R code. It has many great features to make R programming easier! 2.3 Install R + RStudio For better coding and running R, you should install both R and RStudio. You could code R with the installation of R only, however, RStudio provides you with more convenience in coding. In this course, we will use RStudio to do all the course lectures and exercises. Please make sure you install both of them! R could be downloaded here and RStudio could be downloaded here (choose the free version). Both Windows OS (Operating System) and Mac OS are supported. You should choose the right one you need for your own system. (If you have any questions about the installation of R or RStudio, please come during the office hours or ask IT for help). 2.4 Familiar with the user interface of RStudio Below is a screenshot of the user interface of RStudio. You will find couple of panes/windows with different usages.(Selvam 2019) Menu/Tool Bar Source The pane where you write and edit your codes. Environment/History Environment lists all the variables that you are currently using. History presents the codes you have run before. Console Console is the original R interactive window. You could run codes and see the results here. Plot/Help Plot window shows the output figures. Help window presents the information of the function or package you are checking. 2.5 Create and save R file Three ways to create an R file in the RStudio: 1. Menu -&gt; File -&gt; New File -&gt; R Script 2. Shortcut: Ctrl + Shift + N 3. Tool Bar -&gt; New file button Also three ways to save R file 1. Menu -&gt; File -&gt; Save 2. Shortcut: Ctrl + S 3. Tool Bar -&gt; Save file button 2.6 Print Hello, world Its time to code something and output the results! Lets print the very classic Hello, world! with print() function. After coding, we could run our codes in several ways: Select the codes or put the cursor in the line of your code, and click the Run button located in the right-top position of the source pane. Select the codes or put the cursor in the line of your code, and use shortcut: Ctrl + Enter You could also click the Re-run button near the Run button to re-run the codes you ran last time. print(&#39;Hello, world!&#39;) ## [1] &quot;Hello, world!&quot; Because what we need to output here is a string variable, we have to put them in the quotation mark. Either single quotation or double quotation mark works well. Lets see another example. print(5928) ## [1] 5928 Here, 5928 is an integer and we do not need to put them in the quotation marks. 2.7 Install and use R Packages R is easy to use because it has tons of packages with different usages. These packages could help you accomplish some complex tasks with just several lines of codes (another reason we like to use R). Some packages have already been installed and you could use them directly, which are base packages. However, most of the packages have to be installed before being called in the codes. There are couple of ways you could install a package. Lets take the tidyverse package for example. 1. Manu -&gt; Tools -&gt; Install Packages... -&gt; Input the package name -&gt; Click Install button 2. Use the code below: install.packages(&quot;gbm&quot;) After the installation of the package, you have import it with library() function before you use the functions in the package. library(gbm) ## Loaded gbm 2.1.8 We will spend more time in future classes to explore the various R packages and their usages. 2.8 Make notes It is important to write notes for your codes. It could help others or even yourself understand your codes easily. Use hash tag to indicate the notes. For example, gbm1 &lt;- gbm(AvgMet~PkAreaH+StpNumH+DisToMin, # formula data=MetM, # dataset var.monotone=c(+1, rep(0,10),rep(0,15)), distribution=&quot;gaussian&quot;, # see the help for other choices n.trees=5000, # number of trees shrinkage=0.001, # shrinkage or learning rate, 0.001 to 0.1 usually work interaction.depth=6, # 1: additive model, 2: two-way interactions, etc. bag.fraction = 0.5, # subsampling fraction, 0.5 is probably best n.minobsinnode = 10, # minimum total weight needed in each node cv.folds = 5) R will not run the codes after hash tags in each line. Please try to write simple but necessary notes for the codes. Keep this as a good habit and you will thank yourself in the future. 2.9 Tips You could divide your codes into sections by putting chunks before each sections with the shortcut Ctrl + Shift + R. This will help you organize your codes. You could run the codes in the chunk by the shortcut Ctrl + Alt + T. Use ? or help() function to find the related instruction or help page, for example, if you want to find the instruction of library() function, just code ?library or help(library) Both will direct you to the instruction page in the help window where you can find how to use these functions. "],["introduction-to-r.html", "Chapter 3 Introduction to R 3.1 Why R and why not R? 3.2 Variable name 3.3 Variable types 3.4 Operations 3.5 Data structures 3.6 Conditional statement (if) 3.7 Loops 3.8 Functions", " Chapter 3 Introduction to R 3.1 Why R and why not R? Before learning R, we need to know why we use R and why we do not use R. Advantages of R (More flexible but less formal) Free and Open source More advanced technique packages Deal with more than one datasets (big data) at the same time Deal with not only data analysis tasks (data visualization, text analysis, creating website, etc.) Advantages of STATA (More formal but less flexible) More algorithms, packages, and implementations of econometrics Faster It is supported by Statacorp so the result is reliable It presents results in a clear format Syntax is simple and standard for most data analysis Help document is formal Besides those advantages, they have a lot of overlaps with each other. People cannot say one is absolutely better than the other. People choose them based on their task requirements. Sometimes, people use both of them for their daily work (e.g., my laptop has both R and STATA). 3.2 Variable name A variable is used to store data including value, vector, data frame, etc., which R could use to manipulate (tutorialspoint 2019b). This chapter introduces variable types, operations between variables, data structures, conditional statements, loops, and functions. Before we start, lets first see how to name a variable. The valid variable name could be constructed with letters, numbers, the dot character (.), and underline character (_). Besides that, a valid variable name should start with a letter or the dot character not followed by a number. Below are some examples of variable names (either good or not good). Examples Validity Discussion var.name  var_name  _var_name  Cannot start with the underline .var_name  var%name  Cannot contain % .2var_name  Cannot use the dot followed by a number to start a variable name 2var_name  Cannot start with a number 3.3 Variable types There are several types of variables which R could recognize, including character, numeric, integer, logical, and complex (Blischak et al. 2019). The type of one variable is decided by the type of value it stores. We can use class() function to check the type of each variable. Character (also known as strings) v &lt;- &quot;Hello, world!&quot; class(v) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; Numeric (real or decimal number/integer) v &lt;- 59.28 class(v) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; Integer (L tells R that this number is an integer) v &lt;- 2L class(v) ## [1] &quot;integer&quot; v &lt;-2 class(v) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; Logical (Usually True or false) v &lt;- TRUE class(v) ## [1] &quot;logical&quot; v &lt;- FALSE class(v) ## [1] &quot;logical&quot; Complex (complex number is another type of number, different with real number) v &lt;- 1 + 4i class(v) ## [1] &quot;complex&quot; It is important to clearly know the type of the variable since different types of variables may have different functions or operations to deal with. Another caveat is that the outlook of the variable may not show its real variable type. For example, a common situation is listed below. v &lt;- &quot;59.28&quot; class(v) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; Here, the number has quotation marks outside, which means it has been transferred to type character. Therefore, please be careful about variable types! 3.4 Operations An operation tells R the mathematical or logical manipulations among variables (tutorialspoint 2019a). 3.4.1 Assignment operations Assignment operators assign values to variables. Left assignment a &lt;- 1 b &lt;&lt;- &quot;Hello, world!&quot; c = c(1, 3, 4) Right assignment 1 -&gt; a 2 -&gt;&gt; b 3.4.2 Arithmetic operations Add 1 + 1 ## [1] 2 Subtract 5 - 3 ## [1] 2 Multiple 3 * 5 ## [1] 15 Divide 5 - 3 ## [1] 2 Power 5 ^ 2 ## [1] 25 5 ** 2 # you can also do power operation like this ## [1] 25 Mode (find the remainder) 5 %% 2 ## [1] 1 3.4.3 Relational operations The relational operators compare the two elements and return a logical value (TRUE or FALSE). Larger 3 &gt; 4 ## [1] FALSE 5 &gt; 3 ## [1] TRUE Smaller 3 &lt; 5 ## [1] TRUE 4 &lt; 2 ## [1] FALSE Equal 4 == 4 ## [1] TRUE 5 == 4 ## [1] FALSE Note that double equal sign == is relational operation and single equal sign = is assignment operation. No less than (larger or equal to) 3 &gt;= 4 ## [1] FALSE 2 &gt;= 2 ## [1] TRUE No larger than (smaller or equal to) 5 &lt;= 2 ## [1] FALSE 5 &lt;= 5 ## [1] TRUE Not equal 3 != 4 ## [1] TRUE 3 != 3 ## [1] FALSE 3.4.4 Logical operations Logical operators are operations only for logical, numeric, or complex variable types. Most of the time, we apply them on logical values or variables. For numeric variables, 0 is considered FALSE and non-zero numbers are taken as TRUE (DataMentor 2019). You could use T for TRUE or F for FALSE as abbreviation. Logical And TRUE &amp; TRUE ## [1] TRUE FALSE &amp; TRUE ## [1] FALSE FALSE &amp; FALSE ## [1] FALSE Logical Or TRUE | TRUE ## [1] TRUE FALSE | TRUE ## [1] TRUE FALSE | FALSE ## [1] FALSE Logical Not ! TRUE ## [1] FALSE ! FALSE ## [1] TRUE 3.5 Data structures Variables and values could construct different data structures including vector, matrix, data frame, list, and factor (Kabacoff 2019). Vector You could create a vector with c() function. a &lt;- c(5, 9, 2, 8) # create a numeric vector a # show the value of this vector ## [1] 5 9 2 8 b &lt;- c(&#39;hello&#39;, &#39;world&#39;, &#39;!&#39;) # character vector b ## [1] &quot;hello&quot; &quot;world&quot; &quot;!&quot; c &lt;- c(5, &#39;good&#39;) # if you create a vector containing mixed variable types, such as numeric and character, R will restrict them to be the same variable type, here, character c ## [1] &quot;5&quot; &quot;good&quot; You could select elements in the vector by using var_name[#]. Please pay attention on how R indexes its elements in the data structure. a[3] # select the 3rd element ## [1] 2 b[1:3] # select from the 1st to the 3rd element ## [1] &quot;hello&quot; &quot;world&quot; &quot;!&quot; c[2] # select the 2nd element ## [1] &quot;good&quot; 1:3 means from 1 to 3, so it actually stands for three numbers here, which are 1, 2, 3. Matrix You could create a matrix using matrix() function. a &lt;- matrix(1:6, # the data to be put in the matrix, here we use numbers from 1 to 6 nrow = 2, # number of rows in the matrix ncol = 3, # number of columns in the matrix byrow = FALSE) # how to arrange the data in the matrix, FALSE means by columns, TURE means by rows. a ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 3 5 ## [2,] 2 4 6 For variable selection, the intuitive way is using coordinates. a[2,3] # select the elements in the 2nd row and 3rd column ## [1] 6 You could also select the entire row or column. a[ ,2] # the 2nd column ## [1] 3 4 a[1, ] # the 1st row ## [1] 1 3 5 Data frame Data frame is a frequently-used data type in R. It could include columns with different types of values stored in them. Lets create a data frame with mixed variables types using data.frame() function. ID &lt;- c(1:4) # create ID Name &lt;- c(&#39;A&#39;, &#39;B&#39;, &#39;C&#39;, &#39;D&#39;) # create Name Score &lt;- c(69.5, 77.5, 81.5, 90) # create Score df &lt;- data.frame(ID, Name, Score) # combine the variables into one data frame called df df ## ID Name Score ## 1 1 A 69.5 ## 2 2 B 77.5 ## 3 3 C 81.5 ## 4 4 D 90.0 We created a data frame storing the students ID, name, and their test scores. We can select elements from this data frame with couple of ways. df[2,3] # 2nd row and 3rd column ## [1] 77.5 df[&#39;ID&#39;] # column of variable ID ## ID ## 1 1 ## 2 2 ## 3 3 ## 4 4 df[c(&#39;ID&#39;, &#39;Score&#39;)] # column of ID and Score ## ID Score ## 1 1 69.5 ## 2 2 77.5 ## 3 3 81.5 ## 4 4 90.0 There is another way to select the column by its name, which is more frequently used. When you type $ after the name of the data frame, RStudio will list all the variables in that data frame. df$Name # column of variable Name ## [1] A B C D ## Levels: A B C D List A list could store mixed types of values, which is different from vector. a &lt;- list(ID = c(1, 2), Name = c(&#39;A&#39;, &#39;B&#39;), Score = c(69.5, 89)) When you want to select elements from a list, you could do it in a similar way as a vector. However, list does not define row or column, so you cannot use 2-D coordinates to select elements like a data frame. a[1] ## $ID ## [1] 1 2 a[2:3] ## $Name ## [1] &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; ## ## $Score ## [1] 69.5 89.0 Someone might be confusing since list looks similar to data frame. Here is a good discussion about it. Due to the time limitation, we will not cover this discussion in class. The main idea is that list is more flexible than data frame, while data frame has more restrictions. However, since data frame is more similar to 2-D table structure which is more frequently used in our daily work, we use data frame more than list. Factor Factor is the nominal variable in R. This type will be very useful when we want to analyze data from different groups, such as gender, school, etc. a &lt;- c(1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1) class(a) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; afactor &lt;- factor(a) class(afactor) ## [1] &quot;factor&quot; Use levels() to check the categories in variable afactor. levels(afactor) ## [1] &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;3&quot; 3.6 Conditional statement (if) if (test_expression){ statement_1 } else { statement_2 } If the test_expression returns TRUE, then the codes will go to statement_1, if it returns FALSE, the codes will go to statement_2. You could also omit the else part. if (test_expression){ statement_1 } If the test_expression returns FALSE, the codes will continue to next line. x &lt;- 5 if (x &gt; 3){ print(&#39;x is larger than 3&#39;) } else { print(&#39;x is not larger than 3&#39;) } ## [1] &quot;x is larger than 3&quot; x &lt;- 1 if (x &gt; 3){ print(&#39;x is larger than 3&#39;) } Some other conditional statements include switch() and which(). 3.7 Loops Loops help us repeat the codes. for loop is a commonly-used one. for (range){ statement } range will provide the range for a variable. The form could be i in 1:3, which shows that i will be 1, 2, and 3 in each loop. for (i in 1:3){ print(i) } ## [1] 1 ## [1] 2 ## [1] 3 3.8 Functions Functions are codes that have been defined with specific usage. You only need to input some necessary variables and functions will do the tasks. To use function, you start with the name of the function followed with a pair of parentheses. Then, you input some arguments in the parentheses to give instructions to the function. For example, sum() function could help you add the all the numbers together in a vector or data frame and return the result. sum(c(1, 4, 10, 5)) ## [1] 20 Another example is mean() function, which could help you average the numbers in a vector or data frame and return the result. mean(c(1, 4, 10, 5)) ## [1] 5 In functions, some arguments must be input. For example, you need to input the dataset in mean() function. However, some arguments are not necessary to be input because they have default values. If you do not specify these arguments, then, the function will use their default values. For example, after checking the help page of mean(), you will find that there is an other argument called na.rm which decides whether the missing values should be removed. Lets see the example below. data &lt;- c(1, 4, 5, NA) mean(data) ## [1] NA To avoid this, we need to add an argument to reset the value of na.rm in the mean() function. mean(data, na.rm = TRUE) ## [1] 3.333333 na.rm tells the function whether missing values should be removed during the calculation. Its default value is FALSE, which means that the missing values should not be removed. Calculating the average of a list of numbers containing missing value will return a missing value. Thats why we get NA from our first try. In our second try, we set the value of na.rm to TRUE. The function removes the missing values and we have the correct result in our second try. It is important to use the right function to do the right task. To do this, you have to be familiar with the functions you are using. It needs more practice. "],["data-manipulation-with-base-functions.html", "Chapter 4 Data Manipulation with Base Functions 4.1 Import and save datasets 4.2 View data 4.3 Data selection 4.4 Conditional selection 4.5 Deal with missing values 4.6 Subset 4.7 Merge two datasets 4.8 Column operation", " Chapter 4 Data Manipulation with Base Functions We will introduce how to manipulate with different datasets using base functions in R. 4.1 Import and save datasets There couple of ways to importing and saving different types of datasets (Quick-R 2019c, 2019a). 4.1.1 Import data from commonly-used file types CSV file mydata &lt;- read.csv(&#39;c:/minneapolis.csv&#39;, ## file location and name header = TRUE, ## read the first sep = &#39;,&#39;) ## which type of separation EXCEL file library(readxl) dataset &lt;- read_excel(&#39;c:/mydata.xlsx&#39;, # file location and name sheet = &#39;data&#39;) # name or index of the sheet dta STATA file library(foreign) mydata &lt;- read.dta(&#39;c:/mydata.dta&#39;) # file location and name Below is an easy way to load datasets in RStudio. System tool Besides importing data by codes, you could also import data with the system tool. If this is your first time to use this tool, there may be a process to install the packages depending your options. But dont worry, RStudio can do it by itself. You just need to click the button to approve the installation. File -&gt; Import dataset -&gt; choose the type of dataset you want to import There are some other options or parameters you could set in the import functions listed above (e.g., specify a variable type or try to skip some of the rows). Sometimes it is sort of complex to do it. So for me, I just do those things after I import the dataset. 4.1.2 Save file CSV file write.csv(df, # data &#39;c:/filename.csv&#39;) # file location and name EXCEL file library(xlsx) write.xlsx(mydata, # data &quot;c:/mydata.xlsx&quot;) # file location and name dta STATA file library(foreign) write.dta(mydata, &quot;c:/mydata.dta&quot;) Usually, it takes less time to save file in CSV and CSV file has a smaller size in storage. 4.1.3 File location As you can see in the examples, you need to specify the location (or path) of the file to make sure that R could find your file in the right position. Usually you could find it by checking the system property of the file. You could avoid this. First, put your R file and dataset in the same folder. Then start the R file by double clicking it. R will use the folder where the R file locates as the working folder. Then you could only specify the name of the file. This is recommended. Since it will be easier for others to check your codes since they do not need to change the path of the file. 4.2 View data You could view the variable names and simple description in the Environment pane on the right-top position of RStudio. If you want to view more information, click the variable name and view the variable in a new window. Here, we use the Minneapolis one-year ACS data as a example. This dataset contains the demographic information of the respondents in the city of Minneapolis in the ACS survey from 2010 to 2019. minneapolis &lt;- read.csv(&#39;minneapolis.csv&#39;) You could also view the data in the new window by View() function.

We will cover more about this in our lecture about dplyr. 4.8 Column operation Column operation or vector operation is a very important idea in R. It applies the operations in two columns or the function in one column directly rather than applies them on each element one by one.

We will mainly go through its main functions (BiomedicalDataScience 2019; r-project 2019). 5.1 select() Before the lecture, install the package in your computer. install.packages(&#39;dplyr&#39;) ## you only need to install this package once Lets first import this package. Also, we import the Minneapolis ACS dataset. library(dplyr) minneapolis &lt;- read.csv(&#39;minneapolis.csv&#39;) If we want to select one or more columns (i.e., variables) from the dataset. We could use select() in dplyr. It is similar to subset() , but here, you do not need to use select = c('mpg', 'disp'). You use the names of the columns directly in the function. df &lt;- select(minneapolis, # name of the data frame YEAR, SEX, AGE) # column/variable names you want to select head(df, 3) ## YEAR SEX AGE ## 1 2010 2 59 ## 2 2010 2 29 ## 3 2010 1 54 You could also use the index of the columns. df &lt;- select(minneapolis, # name of the data frame c(1:3)) # index of the columns/variables you want to select head(df, 3) ## YEAR SEX AGE ## 1 2010 2 59 ## 2 2010 2 29 ## 3 2010 1 54 pipe The codes above is kind of a traditional way to do the work. We start with a function and put parameters in the function. However, this is not the typical way to use dplyr. The codes below is a more dplyr way people use the package. We start with the name of the data frame. Then, we put a special sign %&gt;% called pipe after it. We continue from a new line and write the function we want to use. Besides that, we could add more functions with the pipe operator. For example, only show first three observations with head(). minneapolis %&gt;% # name of the data frame select(YEAR, SEX, AGE) %&gt;% # select the columns by their names head(3) ## YEAR SEX AGE ## 1 2010 2 59 ## 2 2010 2 29 ## 3 2010 1 54 The original codes include more (see below). When comparing the codes above and below, you will find that original codes use . as the input of the data frame in the function. However, for easy coding, this . could be omitted if it is in the starting position among the input parameters in the functions. In other words, if this . is not in the starting position, it cannot be omitted. minneapolis %&gt;% select(., YEAR, SEX, AGE) %&gt;% head(., 3) ## YEAR SEX AGE ## 1 2010 2 59 ## 2 2010 2 29 ## 3 2010 1 54 You can also write the codes in only one line, just like the codes below. However, it is recommended to write codes with one function in one line to improve the readiness of the codes. minneapolis %&gt;% select(YEAR, SEX, AGE) %&gt;% head(3) ## YEAR SEX AGE ## 1 2010 2 59 ## 2 2010 2 29 ## 3 2010 1 54 The pipe operation is named after the art work, This is not a pipe, from René Magritte. We will keep using the fashion of pipe in the following lectures. In addition, you can use Ctrl + Shift + M in RStudio to quickly input the pipe operator. Besides selecting some columns you want, you could also exclude the columns you do not want by putting a negative sign - before the variable. minneapolis %&gt;% select(-HISPAN, - FTOTINC) %&gt;% ## exclude HISPAN and FTOTINC from the data frame head(3) ## YEAR SEX AGE RACE EDUC EMPSTAT INCTOT ## 1 2010 2 59 1 10 1 33100 ## 2 2010 2 29 1 10 1 16000 ## 3 2010 1 54 2 7 3 1100 You could use : to select a range of variables. minneapolis %&gt;% select(YEAR:RACE) %&gt;% # select from YEAR to RACE in the data frame head(3) ## YEAR SEX AGE RACE ## 1 2010 2 59 1 ## 2 2010 2 29 1 ## 3 2010 1 54 2 Or exclude a range of variables. minneapolis %&gt;% select(-(YEAR:RACE)) %&gt;% # exclude the variables from YEAR to RACE in the data frame head(3) ## HISPAN EDUC EMPSTAT INCTOT FTOTINC ## 1 0 10 1 33100 49100 ## 2 0 10 1 16000 49100 ## 3 0 7 3 1100 NA Below are some advanced techniques to select columns. You can select the column with their names starting with the string(s) you specify in starts_with(). For example, the codes below select the columns with names starting with E. minneapolis %&gt;% select(starts_with(&#39;E&#39;)) %&gt;% head(3) ## EDUC EMPSTAT ## 1 10 1 ## 2 10 1 ## 3 7 3 It may not make sense to you at first. I apologize that the example above is not a good one. In my experience, I have dealt with a traffic dataset that contains variables such as AADT_2010, AADT_2011, AADT_2012, AADT_2013, AADT_2014, AADT_2015. In this case, you can use codes like select(starts_with('AADT')) to select all similar columns. Since we have starts_with(), you may be wondering it there is ends_with().

You will get the same result. plot(INCTOT ~ AGE, data = minneapolis) # you have to specify the name of the data frame here 6.2 Line plot You could transfer the scatter plot above to a line plot by just adding a type variable to indicate that you are plotting a line.

You could use barplot() to draw it. barplot(mean_income$AvgInc, names.arg = mean_income$YEAR) # names.org indicates the vector of names to be plotted under each bar 6.4 Add more elements in the plots For a reader-friendly plots, you have to add more information such as title, labels, and legend. For the plot above, we could use the codes below to make it more informative. barplot(mean_income$AvgInc, names.arg = mean_income$YEAR, main = &#39;Bar plot of the average personal income in Minneapolis (2010-2019)&#39;, # add title for the plot xlab = &#39;Year&#39;, # add label tag for the x-axis ylab = &#39;Personal income (dollars)&#39;, # add label for the y-axis ylim = c(0, 65000), # set the range of y axis, you could set the range of x axis with xlim legend = &#39;Personal income&#39;) # add legend name 6.5 Pie chart Pie chart is a good way to show the share of each part.

It is to present the distribution of the dataset based on their quartiles. In R, you could use boxplot() to draw a box plot. t &lt;- c(1, 5, 10, 7, 8, 10, 11, 19) boxplot(t, range = 0) # set range = 0 makes the whiskers reach the smallest and largest values in the dataset t &lt;- c(1, 5, 10, 7, 8, 10, 11, 19) boxplot(t, range = 1) # set range = 1 makes the the whiskers extend to the most extreme data point which is no more than range times the interquartile range from the box 6.7 Color in R You could change the color of the plots by adding col = in the functions. For example. plot(AvgInc ~ YEAR, data = mean_income, type = &#39;b&#39;, col = &#39;YellowGreen&#39;) # specify the name of the color Here is a link where you could find the name of the color. You could also use the hexadecimal color code to indicate the color. For example. barplot(mean_income$AvgInc, names.arg = mean_income$YEAR, main = &#39;Bar plot of the average personal income in Minneapolis (2010-2019)&#39;, xlab = &#39;Year&#39;, ylab = &#39;Personal income (dollars)&#39;, ylim = c(0, 65000), legend = &#39;Personal income&#39;, col = &#39;#009999&#39;) # use the hexadecimal color code, you need to start it with the hash tag By the same link, you could also find the hexadcimal code for each color.

In the final project, you will use the R programming skills you learn from this course and also the knowledge outside the course (other R techniques you are interested in and your professional knowledge in your study major) to solve a research question. The research question could be related your study field (e.g., public policy, urban and regional planning, public health, etc.), or what you are interested in, or your previous course or research project but you do it with R instead. The originality of your research question is not necessary. You could use any packages in R to solve the problem. For example, you could use plots to do descriptive analysis. Or you could use regression to find correlation or causality. The final product is a poster. This assignment accounts for 30% of your final grades. 7.2 Timeline To accomplish the final project, you need to finish two tasks. Task Descriptions Due Date 1 Proposal Your research question and data source introduction 16th Apr. 2 Poster A poster representing your analysis result 7th May. 7.3 Proposal of problem statement In this task, you will need to submit the proposal file (either word or pdf).
