# Data Manipulation with dplyr

In this chapter, we will learn a very popular package ``dplyr`` to deal with data manipulation. We will mainly go through its main functions [@biomed1;@rpro1].

## select()

Before the lecture, install the package in your computer.

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages('dplyr') ## you only need to install this package once
```


Let's first import this package. Also, we import the Minneapolis ACS dataset.

```{r message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
minneapolis <- read.csv('minneapolis.csv')
```

If we want to select one or more columns (i.e., variables) from the dataset. We could use ``select()`` in ``dplyr``. It is similar to ``subset()`` , but here, you do not need to use ``select = c('mpg', 'disp')``. You use the names of the columns directly in the function.

```{r}
df <- select(minneapolis, # name of the data frame
       YEAR, SEX, AGE) # column/variable names you want to select
head(df, 3)
```

You could also use the index of the columns.

```{r}
df <- select(minneapolis, # name of the data frame
       c(1:3)) # index of the columns/variables you want to select
head(df, 3)
```

**pipe**  

The codes above is kind of a *traditional* way to do the work. We start with a function and put parameters in the function. However, this is not the typical way to use ``dplyr``.

The codes below is a more ``dplyr`` way people use the package. We start with the name of the data frame. Then, we put a special sign ``%>%`` called ``pipe`` after it. We continue from a new line and write the function we want to use. Besides that, we could add more functions with the pipe operator. For example, only show first three observations with ``head()``.

```{r}
minneapolis %>% # name of the data frame
  select(YEAR, SEX, AGE) %>% # select the columns by their names
  head(3)
```

The original codes include more (see below). When comparing the codes above and below, you will find that original codes use ``.`` as the input of the data frame in the function. However, for easy coding, this ``.`` could be omitted if it is in the starting position among the input parameters in the functions. In other words, if this ``.`` is not in the starting position, it cannot be omitted.

```{r}
minneapolis %>% 
  select(., YEAR, SEX, AGE) %>% 
  head(., 3)
```

You can also write the codes in only one line, just like the codes below. However, **it is recommended to write codes with one function in one line to improve the readiness of the codes**.

```{r}
minneapolis %>% select(YEAR, SEX, AGE) %>% head(3)
```

The pipe operation is named after the art work, *This is not a pipe*, from Ren√© Magritte.

We will keep using the fashion of pipe in the following lectures. In addition, you can use ``Ctrl + Shift + M`` in RStudio to quickly input the pipe operator.

Besides selecting some columns you want, you could also exclude the columns you do not want by putting a negative sign ``-`` before the variable.

```{r}
minneapolis %>%
  select(-HISPAN, - FTOTINC) %>% ## exclude HISPAN and FTOTINC from the data frame
  head(3)
```

You could use ``:`` to select a range of variables.

```{r}
minneapolis %>%
  select(YEAR:RACE) %>% # select from YEAR to RACE in the data frame
  head(3)
```

Or exclude a range of variables.

```{r}
minneapolis %>%
  select(-(YEAR:RACE)) %>% # exclude the variables from YEAR to RACE in the data frame
  head(3)
```

Below are some advanced techniques to select columns.

You can select the column with their names starting with the string(s) you specify in ``starts_with()``. For example, the codes below select the columns with names starting with ``E``.

```{r}
minneapolis %>% 
  select(starts_with('E')) %>% 
  head(3)
```
It may not make sense to you at first. I apologize that the example above is not a good one. In my experience, I have dealt with a traffic dataset that contains variables such as ``AADT_2010``, ``AADT_2011``, ``AADT_2012``, ``AADT_2013``, ``AADT_2014``, ``AADT_2015``. In this case, you can use codes like ``select(starts_with('AADT'))`` to select all similar columns.

Since we have ``starts_with()``, you may be wondering it there is ``ends_with()``. The answer is yes.

```{r}
minneapolis %>% 
  select(ends_with('E')) %>% 
  head(3)
```

You can use ``contains()`` to select the columns containing the string(s) you specify.

```{r}
minneapolis %>% 
  select(contains('INC')) %>% 
  head(3)
```

Other similar functions include ``num_range()``, ``matches()``, ``one_of()``, etc. Feel free to check how they can be used with ``help()``.

## filter()

In ``dplyr``, we use ``filter()`` to select the rows satisfying some conditions.

```{r}
minneapolis %>%
  filter(YEAR == 2015) %>% 
  head(3)
```

Add more conditions by using ``,`` to separate them.

```{r}
minneapolis %>%
  filter(YEAR == 2015,
         AGE == 37,
         SEX == 1) %>% 
  head(3)
```

```{r}
minneapolis %>%
  filter(YEAR == 2015,
         INCTOT > mean(INCTOT, na.rm = T)) %>% ## select those with an above-average personal income
  head(3)
```
``,`` serves as an ``logical and`` here. Instead, you can use ``&``.

```{r}
minneapolis %>%
  filter(YEAR == 2015 & INCTOT > mean(INCTOT, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  head(3)
```
You may use ``|`` to stand for ``logical or``.

```{r}
minneapolis %>%
  filter(YEAR == 2015 | YEAR == 2017) %>% ## select those in 2015 or 2017
  head()
```


## arrange()

We could arrange the order of some columns by ``arrange()`` functions.

```{r}
minneapolis %>%
  arrange(YEAR) %>% # arrange YEAR in ascending order
  head(5)
```

Or maybe we want ``YEAR`` to be in a descending order. Just put a ``desc()`` outside the variable.

```{r}
minneapolis %>%
  arrange(desc(YEAR)) %>%
  head(5)
```

We could put them together by using pipe operators to connect them.

```{r}
minneapolis %>%
  filter(YEAR == 2010) %>% ## filter rows
  select(YEAR, SEX, AGE) %>% ## select columns
  arrange(desc(SEX), AGE) %>% ## arrange order
  head(5) ## show the first 5 observations
```

## mutate()

We use ``mutate()`` to do operation among the variables and create a new column to store them.

```{r}
minneapolis %>%
  select(INCTOT) %>% 
  mutate(INCTOTK = INCTOT/1000) %>% ## transfer the unit of personal income from dollar to k dollar
  head(5)
```

You can include more than one assignment operations in ``mutate()``.

```{r}
minneapolis %>%
  select(INCTOT, FTOTINC) %>% 
  mutate(INCTOTK = INCTOT/1000,
         FTOTINCK = FTOTINC/1000) %>%
  head(10)
```

You can use ``ifelse()`` to change the value satisfying the specified condition. ``if_else()`` works but is more strict in variable types. See its help page for more information.

```{r}
minneapolis %>% 
  mutate(
    SEX = ifelse(SEX == 1, 'Male', 'Female') ## change the value of SEX from 1 to Male, otherwise, Female
  ) %>% 
  head(5)
```

If you have more than one conditions, you can use ``case_when()``.

```{r}
minneapolis %>% 
  mutate(
    RACE = case_when( ## change RACE from numeric values to racial categories
      RACE == 1 ~ 'White',
      RACE == 2 ~ 'African American',
      RACE == 3 ~ 'American Indian'
    )
  ) %>% 
  head(5)
```

```{r}
minneapolis %>% 
  mutate(
    IncLevl = case_when( ## categorize personal income into three levels
      INCTOT < median(INCTOT, na.rm = T) ~ 'Low income',
      INCTOT > median(INCTOT, na.rm = T) ~ 'High income',
      TRUE ~ 'Median income'
    )
  ) %>% 
  head(5)
```


## group_by() and summarise()

We use ``group_by()`` to do aggregation (group the observations based the values of one or one more columns) work and ``summarise()`` to calculate some statistics related to each group. Below is a plot to show how it works.

<center>
![](Pics/group.jpg)
</center>

```{r, eval=FALSE}
dataset %>% 
  group_by(Name) %>% 
  summarise(TotalSocre = sum(Score))
```

When it comes to our Minneapolis ACS dataset, we can use the combination of ``group_by()`` and ``summarise()`` to help use with many tasks.

```{r}
minneapolis %>%
  group_by(YEAR) %>%  ## aggregate the data based on YEAR
  summarise(count = n(), ## number of respondents in each year
            AvgInc = mean(INCTOT, na.rm = T)) ## average personal income in each year
```

```{r, message=FALSE}
minneapolis %>%
    mutate(
    RACE = case_when( ## change RACE from numeric values to racial categories
      RACE == 1 ~ 'White',
      RACE == 2 ~ 'African American',
      RACE == 3 ~ 'American Indian'
    )
  ) %>% 
  group_by(YEAR, RACE) %>% ## aggregate the data based on YEAR and RACE
  summarise(MaxInc = max(INCTOT, na.rm = T)) ## maximum personal income for different racial groups in each year
```

## join()

We could use ``join()`` to do the same work of ``merge()``.

```{r}
Name <- c('A', 'B', 'C') # create variable Name
MathScore <- c(87, 98, 95) # create variable Score1
df1 <- data.frame(Name, MathScore) # combine the variables into one data frame
df1

Name <- c('B', 'D', 'C', 'A') # create variable Name
PhysicsScore <- c(99, 66, 98, 77) # create variable Score2
df2 <- data.frame(Name, PhysicsScore) # combine the variables into one data frame
df2
```

```{r warning = F}
df1 %>%
  left_join(df2, by = 'Name')
```

```{r warning = F}
df1 %>%
  right_join(df2, by = 'Name')
```

Could you tell the difference between ``left_join()`` and ``right_join()``?

<center>
![](Pics/join1.jpg)
</center>

Besides ``left_join()`` and ``right_join()``, we have ``inner_join()`` (keep only matched observations of two data frames) and ``full_join()`` (keep all observations of two data frames).

The codes below joins the poverty threshold dataset to the Minneapolis ACS dataset.

```{r}
## import poverty threshold dataset
poverty <- read.csv('poverty.csv')

head(poverty, 10)
```

The poverty threshold dataset lists the poverty threshold in terms of personal income in the US from 2010 to 2019. The data was retrieved from this  [link](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-poverty-thresholds.html)


```{r}
## join the poverty threshold dataset to the Minneapolis ACS dataset based on YEAR
minneapolis %>% 
  left_join(poverty, by = 'YEAR') %>% 
  head(10)
```

Sometimes, people from different groups may give the same variables with different variable names. In this case, you may need to change the codes a little bit.

```{r}
minneapolis %>% 
  rename(TIME = YEAR) %>% ## rename the YEAR to TIME
  left_join(poverty, by = c('TIME' = 'YEAR')) %>% 
  head(10)
```

``rename()`` can help rename the column name in the data frame.

## pivot_wider() and pivot_longer() in tidyr

We can categorize the data frame into two types. One is long data, the other is wide data. In the long form, each row is a score of one discipline for one student. In the wide form, each row contains the scores of all three disciplines for one student.

<center>
![](Pics/long_wide.jpg){ width=75% }
</center>

The long form and wide form data can be transformed to each other. We will use the example below as an illustration.

```{r, message=FALSE}
max_income <- minneapolis %>%
    mutate(
    RACE = case_when( ## change RACE from numeric values to racial categories
      RACE == 1 ~ 'White',
      RACE == 2 ~ 'African American',
      RACE == 3 ~ 'American Indian'
    )
  ) %>% 
  group_by(YEAR, RACE) %>% ## aggregate the data based on YEAR and RACE
  summarise(MaxInc = max(INCTOT, na.rm = T)) ## maximum personal income for different racial groups in each year

head(max_income, 10)
```

We will use ``pivot_wider()`` and ``pivot_longer()`` in ``tidyr`` to do the task.

```{r}
## import the package
library(tidyr)
```

```{r}
## from long to wide
wide_data <- max_income %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = RACE, values_from = MaxInc)

wide_data
```

```{r}
## from wide to long
wide_data %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = `African American`:White, names_to = 'RACE', values_to = 'MaxInc')
```
