# Data Manipulation with dplyr

In this chapter, we will learn a very popular package ``dplyr`` to deal with data manipulation. We will mainly go through its main functions [@biomed1;@rpro1].

## select()

Before the lecture, install the package in your computer.

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages('dplyr') ## you only need to install this package once
```


Let's first import this package. Also, we import the Minneapolis ACS dataset.

```{r message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
minneapolis <- read.csv('minneapolis.csv')
```

If we want to select one or more columns (i.e., variables) from the dataset. We could use ``select()`` in ``dplyr``. It is similar to ``subset()`` , but here, you do not need to use ``select = c('mpg', 'disp')``. You use the names of the columns directly in the function.

```{r}
df <- select(minneapolis, # name of the data frame
       YEAR, SEX, AGE) # column/variable names you want to select
head(df, 3)
```

You could also use the index of the columns.

```{r}
df <- select(minneapolis, # name of the data frame
       c(1:3)) # index of the columns/variables you want to select
head(df, 3)
```

**pipe**  

The codes above is kind of a *traditional* way to do the work. We start with a function and put parameters in the function. However, this is not the typical way to use ``dplyr``.

The codes below is a more ``dplyr`` way people use the package. We start with the name of the data frame. Then, we put a special sign ``%>%`` called ``pipe`` after it. We continue from a new line and write the function we want to use. Besides that, we could add more functions with the pipe operator. For example, only show first three observations with ``head()``.

```{r}
minneapolis %>% # name of the data frame
  select(YEAR, SEX, AGE) %>% # select the columns by their names
  head(3)
```

The original codes include more (see below). When comparing the codes above and below, you will find that original codes use ``.`` as the input of the data frame in the function. However, for easy coding, this ``.`` could be omitted if it is in the starting position among the input parameters in the functions. In other words, if this ``.`` is not in the starting position, it cannot be omitted.

```{r}
minneapolis %>% 
  select(., YEAR, SEX, AGE) %>% 
  head(., 3)
```

You can also write the codes in only one line, just like the codes below. However, **it is recommended to write codes with one function in one line to improve the readiness of the codes**.

```{r}
minneapolis %>% select(YEAR, SEX, AGE) %>% head(3)
```

The pipe operation is named after the art work, *This is not a pipe*, from RenÃ© Magritte.

We will keep using the fashion of pipe in the following lectures. In addition, you can use ``Ctrl + Shift + M`` in RStudio to quickly input the pipe operator.

Besides selecting some columns you want, you could also exclude the columns you do not want by putting a negative sign ``-`` before the variable.

```{r}
minneapolis %>%
  select(-HISPAN, - FTOTINC) %>% ## exclude HISPAN and FTOTINC from the data frame
  head(3)
```

You could use ``:`` to select a range of variables.

```{r}
minneapolis %>%
  select(YEAR:RACE) %>% # select from YEAR to RACE in the data frame
  head(3)
```

Or exclude a range of variables.

```{r}
minneapolis %>%
  select(-(YEAR:RACE)) %>% # exclude the variables from YEAR to RACE in the data frame
  head(3)
```

Below are some advanced techniques to select columns.

You can select the column with their names starting with the string(s) you specify in ``starts_with()``. For example, the codes below select the columns with names starting with ``E``.

```{r}
minneapolis %>% 
  select(starts_with('E')) %>% 
  head(3)
```
It may not make sense to you at first. I apologize that the example above is not a good one. In my experience, I have dealt with a traffic dataset that contains variables such as ``AADT_2010``, ``AADT_2011``, ``AADT_2012``, ``AADT_2013``, ``AADT_2014``, ``AADT_2015``. In this case, you can use codes like ``select(starts_with('AADT'))`` to select all similar columns.

Since we have ``starts_with()``, you may be wondering it there is ``ends_with()``. The answer is yes.

```{r}
minneapolis %>% 
  select(ends_with('E')) %>% 
  head(3)
```

You can use ``contains()`` to select the columns containing the string(s) you specify.

```{r}
minneapolis %>% 
  select(contains('INC')) %>% 
  head(3)
```

Other similar functions include ``num_range()``, ``matches()``, ``one_of()``, etc. Feel free to check how they can be used with ``help()``.

## filter()

In ``dplyr``, we use ``filter()`` to select the rows satisfying some conditions.

```{r}
minneapolis %>%
  filter(YEAR == 2015) %>% 
  head(3)
```

Add more conditions by using ``,`` to separate them.

```{r}
minneapolis %>%
  filter(YEAR == 2015,
         AGE == 37,
         SEX == 1) %>% 
  head(3)
```

```{r}
minneapolis %>%
  filter(YEAR == 2015,
         INCTOT > mean(INCTOT, na.rm = T)) %>% ## select those with an above-average personal income
  head(3)
```
``,`` serves as an ``logical and`` here. Instead, you can use ``&``.

```{r}
minneapolis %>%
  filter(YEAR == 2015 & INCTOT > mean(INCTOT, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  head(3)
```
You may use ``|`` to stand for ``logical or``.

```{r}
minneapolis %>%
  filter(YEAR == 2015 | YEAR == 2017) %>% ## select those in 2015 or 2017
  head()
```


## arrange()

We could arrange the order of some columns by ``arrange()`` functions.

```{r}
minneapolis %>%
  arrange(YEAR) %>% # arrange YEAR in ascending order
  head(5)
```

Or maybe we want ``YEAR`` to be in a descending order. Just put a ``desc()`` outside the variable.

```{r}
minneapolis %>%
  arrange(desc(YEAR)) %>%
  head(5)
```

We could put them together by using pipe operators to connect them.

```{r}
minneapolis %>%
  filter(YEAR == 2010) %>% ## filter rows
  select(YEAR, SEX, AGE) %>% ## select columns
  arrange(desc(SEX), AGE) %>% ## arrange order
  head(5) ## show the first 5 observations
```

## mutate()

We use ``mutate()`` to do operation among the variables and create a new column to store them.

```{r}
minneapolis %>%
  select(INCTOT) %>% 
  mutate(INCTOTK = INCTOT/1000) %>% ## transfer the unit of personal income from dollar to k dollar
  head(5)
```


```{r}
minneapolis %>%
  select(INCTOT, FTOTINC) %>% 
  mutate(INCTOTK = INCTOT/1000, FTOTINCK = FTOTINC/1000) %>%
  head(10)
```

## group_by() and summarise()

We use ``group_by()`` to do aggregation (group the observations based the values of one or one more columns) work and ``summarise()`` to calculate some statistics related to each group.

```{r}
minneapolis %>%
  group_by(YEAR) %>%
  summarise(count = n(),
            AvgInc = mean(INCTOT, na.rm = T))
```

```{r, message=FALSE}
minneapolis %>%
  filter(YEAR == 2010) %>% 
  group_by(YEAR, RACE) %>%
  summarise(MaxInc = max(INCTOT, na.rm = T))
```

## join()

We could use ``join()`` to do the same work of ``merge()``.

```{r}
ID <- c(1:4) # create variable ID
Name <- c('A', 'B', 'C', 'D') # create variable Name
Score1 <- c(69.5, 77.5, 99, 90) # create variable Score1
df1 <- data.frame(ID, Name, Score1) # combine the variables into one data frame called df1
df1

Name <- c('A', 'D', 'C') # create variable Name
Score2 <- c(98, 46, 55) # create variable Score2
df2 <- data.frame(Name, Score2) # combine the variables into one data frame called df2
df2
```

```{r warning = F}
df1 %>%
  left_join(df2, by = 'Name')
```

```{r warning = F}
df1 %>%
  right_join(df2, by = 'Name')
```

Could you tell the difference between ``left_join()`` and ``right_join()``?

Besides ``left_join()`` and ``right_join()``, we have ``inner_join()`` (keep only matched observations of two data frames) and ``full_join()`` (keep all observations of two data frames).
