# Course Syllabus

## Course Description

Introduction to ``RStudio`` software. Use of ``RStudio`` to carry out ``R`` file and related dataset management functions. Tools and techniques for data analysis and statistical programming in quantitative research or related applied areas. Topics include data selection, data manipulation, and data visualization (including charts, plots, histograms, maps, and other graphs).

## Course Prerequisites

Introductory statistics (regression is not necessary); ability to create bar graphs, line graphs, and scatter plots in MS Excel; and familiarity with principles of data visualization.

## Logistics

**Lecture section**: 2:30 - 3:45 pm Tuesday and Thursday  
**Instructor**: Tao Tao, taotao@umn.edu  
**Instruction mode**: Completely online (Link in Canvas)  
**Office hour**: 4:00-5:00 Tuesday (Link in Canvas) or by appointment  
**Canvas**: All course notes will be posted in this course website, but links will be updated on ``Canvas`` simultaneously. ``Canvas`` will also be used to submit your assignments, final project, and grades. Make sure you have enabled the notification of this course on ``Canvas``.

## Course Learning Outcomes

At the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. Use RStudio to carry out R file and related database management
2. Use R to work with different types of databases and conduct basic data management
3. Use R to visualize data with different types of plots
4. Use R to carry out exploratory data analysis

## Readings
The online note is the main study material in this course.  The course has several supplementary reading materials, which are available online from the university library.  
1. Wickham, H. (2016). *ggplot2: elegant graphics for data analysis*. Springer.  
2. Wickham, H., & Grolemund, G. (2016). *R for data science: import, tidy, transform, visualize, and model data*. O'Reilly Media, Inc.


## In-class exercise and final project

1. An in-class exercise will be assigned during each class for the students to practice what they have learned. 
2. The in-class exercises will be mostly finished during the class time, and students are still required to submit their codes on the same day with necessary notes to indicate their ideas.
3. Students will use the knowledge from this course to complete a final project (data analysis for a interested research question and make a poster to show off their work).
4. Grading policy

* Weekly assignment: 70% (10% for each week)
* Final project: 30%

## Homework and projects collaboration and submission policy

1. **Students can discuss their works with other students, but must code and write up notes by themselves. [Plagiarism](https://communitystandards.umn.edu/content/plagiarism) is not allowed by the university policies. Please do be careful about this.**
2. In-class exercises and projects should be submitted through **Canvas**. If you cannot attend the class, please write a email to the instructor including a valid reason before the class. Then you can make up the in-class exercise in the following one week after the class.
3. When you communicate the instructor with emails, please include ``PA 5928`` at the beginning of your title.
